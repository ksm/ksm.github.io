I now work at [Base](http://getbase.com/) on their iOS app. I'm still discovering the black box that is Computer Science, albeit only in the little bits of free time that I can muster.\r\n\r\n### Me, elsewhere\r\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/karolsmazur)\r\n- [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/u:nvln)\r\n- [GitHub](http://github.com/ksm)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
